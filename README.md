# Finance Dashboard with Machine Learning Predictions

Welcome to the **Finance Dashboard** project! This application allows users to manage their financial data and view machine learning-powered predictions for future trends. The frontend is built with React, Redux Toolkit, and Material UI, while the backend uses Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. The app also incorporates machine learning to forecast financial trends.
